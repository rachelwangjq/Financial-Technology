#daily return data of 49 different industries and market excess return data
#apply machine learning tools to develop a market-timing strategy to decide when to go long/short the S&P500 index
#This is in general a difficult problem since the probability of the index going up on any given day is 0.5.
#Intuition:
#information effecting one industry may effect other industries but these cross-industry linkages are subtle
#uncover these linkages by estimating the relationship between different industriesâ€™ returns and subsequent market return
